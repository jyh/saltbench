docstring: |
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note:
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.
test_cases:
  - input: 5
    expected_output: [1, 5]
